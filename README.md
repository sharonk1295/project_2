# What's On Your Vanity?

1. Technologies used
..* HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Mongoose, Express and JSX
2. First made sure that all 7 RESTful routes worked with basic CRUD functionality. Then I made sure to style the app in a way so that the user is not confused when using it.
3. On top of using vanilla CSS, I used CSS Bootstrap to mainly style this application
4. Having some sort of date countdown would be cool
